# Generative UX Demo

"What if there was more to interacting with AI than pure text interfaces?"

"Could user experiences be generated dynamically on the fly not just the content but also the elements themselves?"

These are a few of the questions I wanted to explore when I created this project for a weekend hackathon. The chatbot will:
1. take requests from the user
2. figure out what information is needed to fufill the request
3. generate the UI that is most effective for obtaining that information

The bot currently doesn't make any real api requests to platforms like uber or doordash to actually book those experiences. More to come in future projects...
