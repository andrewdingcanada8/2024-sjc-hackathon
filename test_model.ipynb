    "1. Analyze the user's query:\n",
    "   - If the query is straightforward (e.g., a direct question about facts or knowledge), respond directly.\n",
    "   - If the query requires an action (e.g., summarizing text, booking a flight, logging a journal entry), proceed to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine action requirements:\n",
    "   - List the information provided 'Provided Details', write None if no additional information provided.\n",

    "- For direct inquiries (e.g., \"Why do dogs wag their tails?\"), provide a normal answer under 'Response' without further action, as a language model would normally.\n",

Booking flights is something I can help with, but I'll need a bit more info to get started. You see, when booking flights, it's crucial to have all the details like how many stops you'd prefer, what your budget looks like, and whether you're flexible with your dates. Could you provide those details? Also, don't forget to tell me if you're looking for round-trip tickets or just a one-way journey. Once I have all this, we can start looking into your options and get everything sorted for your trip!\n",

      "- **Circular Imports:** Be mindful of circular imports (where two or more modules depend on each other to be loaded). This can cause problems in Python. To avoid this, structure your code in a way that import statements do not create a cycle.\n",
      "- **Namespacing:** When you import something using `from module_name import something`, it's directly accessible in your file without a namespace. This can potentially overwrite local variables if they share the same name. To avoid this, you can import the whole module (`import module_a`) and access its content with dot notation (`module_a.my_string`), maintaining a clear namespace.\n",

      "- **Grouping Variables:** If you have multiple variables or configurations to share, consider grouping them in a specific module (e.g., `config.py`) or class.\n",
      "- **Use of `__init__.py`:** For larger projects with multiple sub-modules, you can use `__init__.py` files within your package directories to streamline imports and organize your code better.\n",
      "- **Readability:** Always prioritize readability and maintenance of your code. If sharing a large number of variables or complex objects between modules, carefully consider the structure of your project to keep it manageable.\n",
